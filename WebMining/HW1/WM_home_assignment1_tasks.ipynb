    "\n",
    "This **Home Assignment** is to be submitted and you will be given points for each of the tasks. It familiarizes you with basics of *web crawling* and standard text preprocessing. It then takes a deep dive into *GloVe* one approach for obtaining word embeddings. To train GloVe we will frist construct the co-occurence matrix and then we will use adaptive stochastic gradient descent to minimize the cost function.\n",

    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "* Submit valid _Python3_ code only!\n",
    "* Use external libraries only when specified by task.\n",
    "* Ensure your definitions (functions, classes, methods, variables) follow the specification if\n",
    "  given. The concrete signature of e.g. a function usually can be inferred from task description, \n",
    "  code skeletons and test cases.\n",
    "* Ensure the notebook does not rely on current notebook or system state!\n",
    "  * Use `Kernel --> Restart & Run All` to see if you are using any definitions, variables etc. that \n",
    "    are not in scope anymore.\n",
    "  * Double check if your code relies on presence of files or directories other than those mentioned\n",
    "    in given tasks. Tests run under Linux, hence don't use Windows style paths \n",
    "    (`some\\path`, `C:\\another\\path`). Also, use paths only that are relative to and within your\n",
    "    working directory (OK: `some/path`, `./some/path`; NOT OK: `/home/alice/python`, \n",
    "    `../../python`).\n",
    "* Keep your code idempotent! Running it or parts of it multiple times must not yield different\n",
    "  results. Minimize usage of global variables.\n",

Using the logistic loss function causes large errors to be penalized to an asymptotically constant.\\nConsider linear regression on categorical {0, 1} outcomes to see why this is a problem.

The result of the prediction is a cotinuous function where the values may be positive or negative. In this case you normally have an input dataset with a lot of examples and the the output value for each one of them. The goal is to be able to fit a model to this data set so you are able to predict that output for new different/never seen elements. Following is the classical example of fitting a line to set of points, but in general linear regression could be used to fit more complex models (using higher polynomial degrees):\\n\\nResolving the problem \\nLinea regression can be solved in two different ways: \\n\\nNormal equation (direct way to solve the problem)\\nGradient descent (Iterative approach)\\n\\nLogistic regression\\nIs meant to resolve classification problems where given an element you have to classify the same in N categories. Typical examples are for example given a mail to classify it as spam or not, or given a vehicle find to wich category it belongs (car, truck, van, etc ..). That's basically the output is a finite set of descrete values.  \\nResolving the problem \\nLogistic regression problems could be resolved only by using Gradient descent. The formulation in general is very similar to linear regression the only difference is the usage of different hypothesis function. In linear regression the hypothesis has the form: \\nh(x) = theta_0 + theta_1*x_1 + theta_2*x_2 .. \\n\\nwhere theta is the model we are trying to fit and [1, x_1, x_2, ..] is the input vector. In logistic regression the hypothesis function is different: \\ng(x) = 1 / (1 + e^-x)\\n\\n\\nThis function has a nice property, basically it maps any value to the range [0,1] which is appropiate to handle propababilities during the classificatin. For example in case of a binary classification g(X) could be interpreted as the probability to belong to the positive class. In this case normally you have different classes that are separated with a decision boundary which basically a curve that decides the separation between the different classes. Following is an example of dataset separated in two classes.\\n\\n\",\n   'comments': []},\n  {'text': '\\nThey are both quite similar in solving for the solution, but as others have said, one (Logistic Regression) is for predicting a category \"fit\" (Y/N or 1/0), and the other (Linear Regression) is for predicting a value.\\nSo if you want to predict if you have cancer Y/N (or a probability) - use logistic.  If you want to know how many years you will live to - use Linear Regression !\\n',\n   'comments': []},\n  {'text': '\\nThe basic difference :\\nLinear regression is basically a regression model which means its will give a non discreet/continuous output of a function. So this approach gives the value.

The recorded data is in time increments of 0.05 sec per sample and a graph of altitude vs. time looks pretty much like it should when zoomed out over the entire flight.\\nThe problem is when I try to calculate other values such as velocity or acceleration from the data, the accuracy of the measurements makes the calculated values pretty much worthless.  What techniques can I use to smooth out the data so that I can calculate (or approximate) reasonable values for the velocity and acceleration?  It is important that major events remain in place in time, most notably the 0 for for the first entry and the highest point during flight (2707).\\nThe altitude data follows and is measured in ft above ground level.  The first time would be 0.00 and each sample is 0.05 seconds after the previous sample.  The spike at the beginning of the flight is due to a technical problem that occurred during liftoff and removing the spike is optimal.\\nI originally tried using linear interpolation, averaging nearby data points, but it took many iterations to smooth the data enough for integration and the flattening of the curve removed the important apogee and ground level events.  \\nAll help is greatly appreciated.  Please note this is not the complete data set and I am looking for suggestions on better ways to analyze the data, not for someone to reply with a transformed data set.  It would be nice to use an algorithm on board future rockets which can predict current altitude/velocity/acceleration without knowing the full flight data, though that is not required.\\n00000\\n00000\\n00000\\n00076\\n00229\\n00095\\n00057\\n00038\\n00048\\n00057\\n00057\\n00076\\n00086\\n00095\\n00105\\n00114\\n00124\\n00133\\n00152\\n00152\\n00171\\n00190\\n00200\\n00219\\n00229\\n00248\\n00267\\n00277\\n00286\\n00305\\n00334\\n00343\\n00363\\n00363\\n00382\\n00382\\n00401\\n00420\\n00440\\n00459\\n00469\\n00488\\n00517\\n00527\\n00546\\n00565\\n00585\\n00613\\n00633\\n00652\\n00671\\n00691\\n00710\\n00729\\n00759\\n00778\\n00798\\n00817\\n00837\\n00856\\n00885\\n00904\\n00924\\n00944\\n00963\\n00983\\n01002\\n01022\\n01041\\n01061\\n01080\\n01100\\n01120\\n01139\\n01149\\n01169\\n01179\\n01198\\n01218\\n01238\\n01257\\n01277\\n01297\\n01317\\n01327\\n01346\\n01356\\n01376\\n01396\\n01415\\n01425\\n01445\\n01465\\n01475\\n01495\\n01515\\n01525\\n01545\\n01554\\n01574\\n01594\\n01614\\n01614\\n01634\\n01654\\n01664\\n01674\\n01694\\n01714\\n01724\\n01734\\n01754\\n01764\\n01774\\n01794\\n01804\\n01814\\n01834\\n01844\\n01854\\n01874\\n01884\\n01894\\n01914\\n01924\\n01934\\n01954\\n01954\\n01975\\n01995\\n01995\\n02015\\n02015\\n02035\\n02045\\n02055\\n02075\\n02075\\n02096\\n02096\\n02116\\n02126\\n02136\\n02146\\n02156\\n02167\\n02177\\n02187\\n02197\\n02207\\n02217\\n02227\\n02237\\n02237\\n02258\\n02268\\n02278\\n02278\\n02298\\n02298\\n02319\\n02319\\n02319\\n02339\\n02349\\n02359\\n02359\\n02370\\n02380\\n02380\\n02400\\n02400\\n01914\\n02319\\n02420\\n02482\\n02523\\n02461\\n02502\\n02543\\n02564\\n02595\\n02625\\n02666\\n02707\\n02646\\n02605\\n02605\\n02584\\n02574\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02554\\n02543\\n02554\\n02554\\n02554\\n02554\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02533\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02543\\n02533\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02543\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02523\\n02513\\n02513\\n02502\\n02502\\n02492\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02482\\n02472\\n02472\\n02472\\n02461\\n02461\\n02461\\n02461\\n02451\\n02451\\n02451\\n02461\\n02461\\n02451\\n02451\\n02451\\n02451\\n02451\\n02451\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02441\\n02431\\n02441\\n02431\\n02441\\n02431\\n02420\\n02431\\n02420\\n02420\\n02420\\n02420\\n02420\\n02420\\n02420\\n02420\\n02420\\n02420\\n02420\\n02420\\n02410\\n02420\\n02410\\n02410\\n02410\\n02410\\n02400\\n02400\\n02410\\n02400\\n02400\\n02400\\n02400\\n02400\\n02400\\n02400\\n02400\\n02400\\n02400\\n02400\\n02400\\n02390\\n02390\\n02390\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02380\\n02370\\n02370\\n02380\\n02370\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02359\\n02349\\n02349\\n02349\\n02349\\n02349\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n02339\\n\\n please use the metric system.

I like how this can be adapted to take multiple input sources. The code ran fine and plots. Nice job. But I\\'m not sure the acceleration plot is right - it imitates the velocity too closely, not its derivative.  A flaw in the code, or is this a quirk of Kalman filtering?', '\\nYou could try running the data through a low-pass filter. This will smooth out high frequency noise. Maybe a simple FIR.\\nAlso, you could pull your major events from the raw data, but use a polynomial fit for velocity and acceleration data.\\n I like your comment about the polynomial fit.  Perhaps the flight could be divided in two: before the thrust is finished and after.  After the thrust a parabola would be a natural fit for a polynomial and before that some polynomial with a slightly higher order (3 or 4?).  Extreme values such as the early \"229\" should become outliers and disappear. This answer is right on track. It just needs a specific name to look up... since acceleration and velocity are derivatives respect to time, you should look into Savitzky-Golay.  It\\'s described in Numerical Recipes and online in many places.  Defined as a low-order polynomial fit at each point, it smooths the data and takes a derivative order as a parameter.  This is better numerically than smoothing and then differentiating in separate steps.  S.G. is especially good at preserving peaks, inflection points etc whereas naive attempts at smoothing typically mush out peaks and other fine detail.', '\\nhave you tried performing a scrolling window average of your values ? Basically you perform a window of, say 10 values (from 0 to 9), and calculate its average. then you scroll the window one point (from 1 to 10) and recalculate. This will smooth the values while keeping the number of points relatively unchanged. Larger windows give smoother data at the price of loosing more high-frequency information.\\nYou can use the median instead of the average if your data happen to present outlier spikes.\\nYou can also try with Autocorrelation.\\n I actually did try this, however, I only tried it over a window size of 3.  Perhaps some bigger window tests would make for better data, +1 The shape of the window matters.  If you take a plain simple average of n points to the left and n to the right, along with the point at the center, you get some noise in the output because the points at the ends are entering/leaving the range as you move to calculate the next output point.  Is better to calculate a weighted average - less weight given to points the further they are from the central point.  See other answers for good ways to do this. @DarenW : that\\'s a very good idea. as you said, this way you reduce the \"all-or-nothing\" presence of a point...', '\\nOne way you can approach analyzing you data is to try to match it too some model, generate a function, and then test its fitness to your data set.... This can be rather complicated and is probably unnecessary... but the point is that instead of generating acceleration/velocity data directly from you data you can match it to your model (rather simple for a rocket, some acceleration upwards followed by a slow constant speed descent.)  At least that how i would do it in a physics experiment.\\nAs for generating some sense of velocity and acceleration during flight this should be as simple averaging the velocity from several different results.  Something along the lines of:\\nEsitimatedV = Vmeasured*(1/n) + (1 - 1/n)*EstimatedV.  Set n based on how quickly you want your velocity to adjust by.  \\n', '\\nI know nothing about rockets. I plotted your points and they look lovely.\\nBased on what I see in that plot let me assume that there is usually a single apogee and that the function that gave rise to your points has no derivative wrt time at that apogee.\\nSuggestion:\\n\\nMonitor maximum altitude throughout the flight.\\nContinuously watch for the apogee by (say, simply) comparing the most recent few points with the current maximum.\\nUntil you reach the maximum, with (0,0) fixed and some arbitrary set of knots calculate a collection of natural splines up to the current altitude. Use the residuals wrt the splines to decide which data to discard. Recalculate the splines.\\nAt the maximum retain the most recently calculate splines. Start calculating a new set of splines for the curve beyond the apogee.\\n\\n From my understanding of splines is that they are more useful for generating exact replicas of continuous data than they are interpolating missing or noisy data points.  Am I missing something?  To determine apogee, we take every data point for the last 20 samples and compare it to the last 20 samples before each.  Once all samples show a decline in altitude, we say apogee is the highest recorded value during that interval. You\\'re right. Sloppy thinking. Apologies. Was trying to express: it appears to me that this is not the jagged set of data one often sees in a time series and you might omit the task of identifying a complicated error structure. From the beginning of a flight keep fitting easy smooth curves until you hit the apogee, discarding outliers--which appear obvious from the plot that I made. (Are they obvious to you though?) Then, after you hit the apogee start fitting a distinct set of easy smooth curves for the rest of the flight, again discarding outliers.   In this instance, spline=\"brain f__t\"', '\\nARIMA model and look for autocorrelation in the residual is standard procedure.

What is its purpose?\\n\", \"\\nYou can find the answer in the mailing list archives:\\nThe jitter function in the Visualize panel just adds artificial random\\nnoise to the coordinates of the plotted points in order to spread the\\ndata out a bit (so that you can see points that might have been\\nobscured by others).\\n Load the contact lenses example from Weka, and visualize it. In the first plot, some points are exactly on top of each other. By adding jitter, you can see how many points there are for each combination. This won't work that good for larger data sets, but you can still get an impression. For discrete values, this is quite important.\", \"\\nI don't know weka, but generally jitter is a term for the variation of a periodic signal to some reference interval. I'm guessing the slider allows you to set some range or threshold below which data points are treated as being regular, or to modify the output to introduce some variation. The wikipedia entry can give you some background.\\nUpdate: from this pdf, the jitter slider is for this purpose:\\n\\n“Jitter” option to deal with nominal attributes (and to detect “hidden”data points)\\n\\nBased on the accompanying slide it looks like it introduces some variation in the visualisation, perhaps to show when two data points overlap.\\nUpdate 2: This google books extract (to Data mining By Ian H.
