As regression might actually\nproduce probabilities that could be less than 0, or even bigger than\n1, logistic regression was introduced. \nSource: http://gerardnico.com/wiki/data_mining/simple_logistic_regression\n\nOutcome\nIn linear regression, the outcome (dependent variable) is continuous.\nIt can have any one of an infinite number of possible values. \nIn logistic regression, the outcome (dependent variable) has only a limited number of possible values. \nThe dependent variable\nLogistic regression is used when the response variable is categorical in nature. For instance, yes/no, true/false, red/green/blue,\n1st/2nd/3rd/4th, etc.  \nLinear regression is used when your response variable is continuous. For instance, weight, height, number of hours,  etc.\nEquation\nLinear regression gives an equation which is of the form Y = mX + C,\nmeans equation with degree 1. \nHowever, logistic regression gives an equation which is of the form \nY = eX + e-X\nCoefficient interpretation\nIn linear regression, the coefficient interpretation of independent variables are quite straightforward (i.e. holding all other variables constant, with a unit increase in this variable, the dependent variable is expected to increase/decrease by xxx). \nHowever, in logistic regression, depends on the family (binomial, Poisson,\netc.) and link (log, logit, inverse-log, etc.) you use, the interpretation is different. \nError minimization technique\nLinear regression uses ordinary least squares method to minimise the\nerrors and arrive at a best possible fit, while logistic regression\nuses maximum likelihood method to arrive at the solution.\nLinear regression is usually solved by minimizing the least squares error of the model to the data, therefore large errors are penalized quadratically. \nLogistic regression is just the opposite. Using the logistic loss function causes large errors to be penalized to an asymptotically constant.\nConsider linear regression on categorical {0, 1} outcomes to see why this is a problem. If your model predicts the outcome is 38, when the truth is 1, you've lost nothing. Linear regression would try to reduce that 38, logistic wouldn't (as much)2.\n\n", "comments": ["Is there a difference between Y = e^X/1 + e^-X and Y = e^X + e^-X ?", "e^X/1 ? anything divide by 1 is the same. so there is no difference.

The result of the prediction is a cotinuous function where the values may be positive or negative. In this case you normally have an input dataset with a lot of examples and the the output value for each one of them. The goal is to be able to fit a model to this data set so you are able to predict that output for new different/never seen elements. Following is the classical example of fitting a line to set of points, but in general linear regression could be used to fit more complex models (using higher polynomial degrees):\n\nResolving the problem \nLinea regression can be solved in two different ways: \n\nNormal equation (direct way to solve the problem)\nGradient descent (Iterative approach)\n\nLogistic regression\nIs meant to resolve classification problems where given an element you have to classify the same in N categories. Typical examples are for example given a mail to classify it as spam or not, or given a vehicle find to wich category it belongs (car, truck, van, etc ..). That's basically the output is a finite set of descrete values.  \nResolving the problem \nLogistic regression problems could be resolved only by using Gradient descent. The formulation in general is very similar to linear regression the only difference is the usage of different hypothesis function. In linear regression the hypothesis has the form: \n\nwhere theta is the model we are trying to fit and [1, x_1, x_2, ..] is the input vector. In logistic regression the hypothesis function is different: \n\n\nThis function has a nice property, basically it maps any value to the range [0,1] which is appropiate to handle propababilities during the classificatin. For example in case of a binary classification g(X) could be interpreted as the probability to belong to the positive class. In this case normally you have different classes that are separated with a decision boundary which basically a curve that decides the separation between the different classes. Following is an example of dataset separated in two classes.\n\n", "comments": []}, {"text": "\nThey are both quite similar in solving for the solution, but as others have said, one (Logistic Regression) is for predicting a category \"fit\" (Y/N or 1/0), and the other (Linear Regression) is for predicting a value.\nSo if you want to predict if you have cancer Y/N (or a probability) - use logistic.

So this approach gives the value.

For example : for a given x if f(x)>threshold classify it to be 1 else classify it to be 0.\nFor example given a set of brain tumour size as training data we can use the size as input to determine whether its a benine or malignant tumour.
